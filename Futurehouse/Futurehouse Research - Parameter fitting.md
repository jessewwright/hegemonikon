# Task
Generate a literature review report focused on parameter estimation and identifiability challenges in computational models of decision-making, specifically Drift Diffusion Models (DDMs) or related evidence accumulation models when extended beyond simple perceptual choice.

# Response
Our model, NES, incorporates internal states (norm congruence 'N') and external factors (salience 'S', urgency 'U') into the drift rate (v = w_s*S + w_n*N + w_u*U), uses dynamic thresholds (modulated by affect/serotonin), and includes meta-control (RAA). A recent parameter recovery attempt for a delay discounting task failed to recover k_discount and base_threshold when using a likelihood based only on choice proportions simulated by the model.

This literature review examines parameter estimation and identifiability challenges in computational models of decision‐making, with a focus on Drift Diffusion Models (DDMs) and related evidence accumulation frameworks when these models are extended beyond simple perceptual choice. The review also considers the implications for a novel model—NES—which incorporates internal states (norm congruence “N”) and external factors (salience “S” and urgency “U”) into the drift rate (v = wₛ·S + wₙ·N + wᵤ·U), employs dynamic thresholds that are modulated by affect (e.g., via serotonin) and integrates meta‐control signals (RAA). A recent parameter recovery attempt for NES in a delay discounting task revealed that using a likelihood based solely on choice proportions failed to recover key parameters such as k_discount and base_threshold. To understand these challenges and identify potential solutions, this review synthesizes the literature regarding common trade‐offs in parameter estimation, successful strategies for overcoming these issues, and recommendations for task design.

Identifiability issues have long been recognized as a critical concern in the application of traditional DDMs. In standard DDMs, decisions are modeled as a stochastic accumulation of evidence toward fixed boundaries with key parameters including drift rate (v), threshold (a), starting point bias (z), and non‐decision time (Ter). However, when DDMs are extended to incorporate factors such as value, affect, or rule‐based inputs, additional latent processes are introduced which complicate parameter estimation. For instance, well‐documented trade‐offs occur between threshold settings and drift components, as both can influence response times (RTs) in similar ways, potentially leading to non‐unique parameter estimates (bhui2019testingoptimaltiming pages 9-10). Likewise, trade‐offs between drift rate and non‐decision time have been extensively documented, and these problems are exacerbated when models are applied to complex tasks involving value‐based or socially influenced decisions (desai2019modelingbiasesin pages 74-76). In value‐based decision paradigms, response bias can stem from both inherent psychological predispositions and strategic adjustments, which often overlap with parameters representing evidence accumulation speed, making it challenging to dissociate the influence of internal valuation signals from decisional dynamics (luken2025parameteridentifiabilityin pages 1-2).

One critical challenge lies in the fact that many extended DDM variants introduce additional inputs or modulators—such as value signals, affective states, or social norms—that are modeled as additional components influencing the drift rate. These extensions, as seen in models which incorporate subjective value or neural signals reflective of cognitive control, often result in multiple parameter trade‐offs. For example, when both a subjective value component and a bias component are assumed to influence drift, their effects can be confounded, leading to non‐identifiability if the experimental design does not provide sufficient variability to disentangle them (desai2019modelingbiasesin pages 67-74). Furthermore, the inclusion of dynamic thresholds that adjust with affective state, as proposed in NES, introduces additional complexity with respect to determining whether changes in reaction time distributions are attributable to fluctuations in evidence accumulation or to variations in threshold settings influenced by internal state (kuhne2024improvingthevalidity pages 250-254).

Successful methods to overcome these identifiability issues center on two main strategies: first, the utilization of likelihood functions that incorporate full RT distributions rather than summary measures; and second, the application of hierarchical Bayesian modeling (HBM) to constrain parameter estimates via partial pooling across individuals. Incorporating rich RT data is crucial because RT distributions provide additional constraints that choices alone cannot offer. For example, using an analytical solution to the first‐passage time distribution for the Wiener diffusion process or employing simulation‐based likelihood approximations allows for more robust estimation of parameters, as differences in the shape of RT distributions can help distinguish between effects due to drift rate and those due to threshold adjustments (fengler2023likelihoodapproximationsfor pages 147-149). Similar methodologies have been successfully applied in studies that extended DDMs to value‐based decision tasks, where full RT distributions were critical to disentangle drift bias from starting point bias (lee2023valuecertaintyin pages 8-10). Additionally, likelihood-free inference methods, such as approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and simulation‐based inference, have shown promise in cases where no tractable likelihood functions exist for extended models (fengler2023likelihoodapproximationsfor pages 49-51).

Hierarchical Bayesian modeling has emerged as one of the most effective strategies to address parameter identifiability issues in complex decision models. HBM enables researchers to simultaneously estimate both individual and group‐level parameters, thereby borrowing strength across participants while also capturing individual variability (pedersen2020simultaneoushierarchicalbayesian pages 1-2). By employing informative priors and group-level shrinkage, HBM effectively constrains parameter estimates, which is especially beneficial when data are sparse or when a model includes multiple interdependent parameters. Software packages such as HDDM, Stan, and PyMC have been widely used for this purpose, offering user‐friendly interfaces for specifying and fitting hierarchical models (pedersen2020simultaneoushierarchicalbayesian pages 13-13, pedersen2020simultaneoushierarchicalbayesian pages 2-3). For example, HDDM has been successfully applied to estimate drift diffusion parameters in decision‐making tasks that include not only perceptual components but also cognitive and social influences, thereby facilitating the dissociation of effects arising from value, affect, and strategic control (bhui2019testingoptimaltiming pages 7-8, peters2020thedriftdiffusion pages 9-12).

Task design also plays a critical role in addressing identifiability challenges. Experimental paradigms must be carefully constructed to induce sufficient variability in the behavioral data such that different model parameters can be independently estimated. One common recommendation is to design tasks that elicit intermediate error rates—typically in the range of 5–35%—as extremely high accuracy can mask differences between parameter values (luken2025parameteridentifiabilityin pages 1-2). Moreover, tasks that systematically vary factors such as stimulus strength, time pressure, or incentive structures can help disentangle the contributions of drift rate modulation from changes in threshold or non-decision time (bhui2019testingoptimaltiming pages 8-9, kuhne2024improvingthevalidity pages 21-26). For instance, studies comparing perceptual tasks with value‐based paradigms have implemented manipulations of cognitive control and social norms to observe how such factors modulate decision thresholds differently than they affect drift processes (desai2019modelingbiasesin pages 8-16, ghaderikangavari2023howspatialattention pages 18-20).

Several specific studies offer concrete examples of successful parameter estimation in extended DDMs. Peters and D’Esposito (2020) applied a DDM to inter‐temporal and risky choice tasks, incorporating nonlinear mappings from value differences to drift rate, and used stimulus coding to interpret starting point biases relative to decision alternatives, rather than relying on accuracy coding alone (peters2020thedriftdiffusion pages 17-20). This approach allowed them to capture individual differences in decision caution and drift dynamics, even in clinical populations such as patients with ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) lesions. Similarly, Lee and Usher (2023) extended the classic DDM to incorporate option‐specific value certainty in preferential choice, emphasizing how subjective value representations can be integrated into the drift process and how modulating diffusion noise with value certainty can have counterintuitive effects if not properly constrained (lee2023valuecertaintyin pages 1-4, lee2023valuecertaintyin pages 53-56). Their work demonstrates that including full RT distributions in the analysis not only improves parameter identifiability but also leads to a better qualitative match with empirical data regarding choice consistency and speed. In the realm of social cognition, Parker and Ramsey (2024) reviewed evidence accumulation models applied to tasks with social cues, showing that incorporating RT distributions and employing hierarchical modeling can resolve ambiguities in the influence of social factors on decision parameters such as drift rate and non-decision time (parker2024whatcanevidence pages 9-11).

The model under discussion, NES, extends these established frameworks by incorporating internal normative signals, salience information, and urgency as modulators of the drift rate. Because NES also integrates dynamic thresholds modulated by affect and a meta-control component (RAA), the model inevitably inherits additional layers of parameter interdependency that may lead to identifiability challenges similar to those encountered in other extended DDMs. The failure to recover k_discount and base_threshold in a recent parameter recovery attempt when using likelihood based solely on choice proportions echoes findings in the broader literature that demonstrate the inadequacy of choice-only measures for constraining model parameters (bompas2025nondecisiontimethe pages 3-3, shahar2019improvingthereliability pages 16-17). When only aggregate choice data are considered, it becomes nearly impossible to disentangle the contributions of parameters that similarly influence decision outcomes, such as base thresholds and scaling factors for discounting in delay tasks.

Best practices emerging from the literature suggest that robust parameter estimation for models like NES requires (1) the incorporation of full RT distributions in the likelihood function, (2) the use of hierarchical Bayesian frameworks to impose informed priors and partial pooling, and (3) careful design of experimental tasks that provide independent variation in relevant factors. For instance, when both RT and choice data are modeled simultaneously using the complete RT distribution, the additional information contained in the detailed shape of the RT histogram can help to constrain the model and reduce the ambiguity between threshold adjustments and drift changes (fengler2023likelihoodapproximationsfor pages 34-36). Hierarchical Bayesian methods have been shown to be particularly effective in this regard by stabilizing parameter estimates across subjects, as evidenced by successful implementations in packages like HDDM and Stan (pedersen2020simultaneoushierarchicalbayesian pages 1-2, pedersen2020simultaneoushierarchicalbayesian pages 2-3).

Moreover, experimental manipulations that independently vary factors like stimulus difficulty, incentive structure, or social cues can create behavioral conditions in which the effects of internal state modulations (e.g., norm congruence) can be separated from those of external inputs (e.g., salience and urgency). For example, in studies examining the effects of social cues on decision making, modifications that isolate the influence of gaze versus arrow cues have been shown to differentially affect drift rate and response caution parameters (ghaderikangavari2023howspatialattention pages 2-3, parker2024whatcanevidence pages 2-3). Such targeted designs allow researchers to map specific experimental manipulations to individual model parameters in a more direct manner, thereby reducing the likelihood that parameter trade-offs will preclude unique recovery.

The use of simulation-based parameter recovery studies is another recommended practice. These studies involve generating synthetic datasets from known parameter values and then applying the chosen estimation procedure to recover those values. Recovering the original parameters validates the model and the estimation technique, as shown in several reported cases (lee2023evidenceaccumulatesfor pages 13-16, pedersen2020simultaneoushierarchicalbayesian pages 13-13). When researchers have conducted simulation-based recovery analyses, they can assess which combinations of parameters are most affected by trade-off effects and adjust the model or the estimation procedure accordingly.

In the context of complex models such as NES, where multiple cognitive processes (e.g., valuation, norm processing, affect-modulated dynamic thresholds, and meta-control) interact, it is critical to incorporate data that disentangle these processes. This may require the use of both behavioral and neural measures. For instance, studies integrating EEG measures with DDM fitting have demonstrated that linking neural biomarkers to specific decision components can further constrain parameter estimates and improve identifiability (ghaderikangavari2023howspatialattention pages 18-20, shahar2019improvingthereliability pages 7-8). Although NES is primarily a behavioral model, insights from neuroimaging studies support the notion that additional observable correlates—such as distinct neural signatures associated with norm congruence or meta-control signals—could be incorporated in future iterations to bolster parameter recovery.

In summary, best practices for robust parameter fitting in extended evidence accumulation models like NES include: (1) the use of likelihood functions that exploit the full RT distribution to capture the temporal dynamics of decision making; (2) hierarchical Bayesian modeling to leverage prior information and partial pooling across subjects, thereby reducing variability and improving identifiability; and (3) experimental designs that strategically manipulate key decision variables such that their impacts on model parameters are dissociable. Specific examples from the literature demonstrate that these approaches can successfully accommodate value, affect, and social/normative influences within computational models. For example, the work of Peters and D’Esposito (peters2020thedriftdiffusion pages 6-9) and Lee and Usher (lee2023valuecertaintyin pages 8-10) provides instructive cases where extended DDMs have been fitted to tasks that involve complex valuation and uncertainty processes. Similarly, studies employing HDDM for hierarchical Bayesian inference (pedersen2020simultaneoushierarchicalbayesian pages 1-2) have shown the importance of such techniques in stabilizing parameter estimates and ensuring reliable recovery. Moreover, simulation-based studies underscore the need for robust data and careful model specification (luken2025parameteridentifiabilityin pages 13-14) to prevent trade-offs from undermining parameter interpretability.

For models like NES, which incorporate multiple influences on the drift rate (wₛ, wₙ, wᵤ) and feature dynamic threshold modulations linked to affective state and meta-control contributions, it is essential to leverage all available behavioral dimensions—choice data and full RT distributions—in the fitting procedure. Recent failures in parameter recovery for delay discounting tasks, particularly with parameters such as k_discount and base_threshold, highlight the danger of relying solely on choice proportions (bompas2025nondecisiontimethe pages 3-3). Instead, combining rich, trial-level RT data with hierarchical Bayesian estimation techniques can help disentangle complex parameter interactions, ensure stable recovery of underlying cognitive processes, and ultimately lead to more robust and interpretable models.

A potential solution for NES may involve first validating the model on simulated data using RT distributions in conjunction with choices and then iteratively refining the model estimation process using hierarchical modeling frameworks implemented in software such as HDDM or Stan (pedersen2020simultaneoushierarchicalbayesian pages 2-3, kuhne2024improvingthevalidity pages 246-250). This approach would allow for the identification of specific parameter trade-offs—for example, between dynamic thresholds and k_discount—and facilitate targeted modifications in the model structure or the experimental design. Design modifications might include tasks that vary urgency or affect independently from norm-related manipulations, thereby isolating the contribution of each factor on the drift rate and threshold parameters (desai2019modelingbiasesin pages 67-74, ruesseler2021perceptualdecisionmakingunder pages 27-31). Additionally, embedding meta‐control signals (RAA) into a hierarchical Bayesian framework can offer explicit estimates of the degree to which such signals modulate decision parameters, which in turn can be verified with model recovery tests (kuhne2024improvingthevalidity pages 29-32).

Overall, the literature reveals that while the extension of DDMs to encompass richer cognitive phenomena such as value‐based, affect‐driven, or socially influenced decision processes undoubtedly increases the number of parameters and their interdependencies, these challenges can be effectively managed by integrating full RT distributions into likelihood functions, adopting hierarchical Bayesian methods to constrain parameter estimates, and carefully designing tasks to induce the necessary behavioral variability for parameter disentanglement. This multi-pronged approach is central not only to the successful application of established extended DDMs but also to the robust fitting of novel models like NES that aim to capture complex cognitive dynamics by incorporating both internal normative states and external modulatory factors.

In conclusion, robust parameter estimation in complex decision-making models requires an integrative strategy that leverages detailed temporal data, advanced statistical techniques, and optimized experimental designs. By following best practices—incorporating full RT distributions into likelihood functions, employing hierarchical Bayesian modeling for enhanced parameter recovery, and using experimental manipulations designed to dissociate overlapping cognitive influences—researchers can overcome the well-known identifiability issues inherent in extended DDMs. Such approaches have been successfully demonstrated in studies of value-based decision making and social cognition and provide a strong foundation for the further development and application of models like NES to behavioral data that combine choice and reaction time information (fengler2023likelihoodapproximationsfor pages 46-49, parker2024whatcanevidence pages 3-5). These advances will ultimately elucidate the underlying cognitive mechanisms and improve the interpretability and reliability of complex decision models in both research and applied settings (shahar2019improvingthereliability pages 7-8, pedersen2020simultaneoushierarchicalbayesian pages 13-13).
