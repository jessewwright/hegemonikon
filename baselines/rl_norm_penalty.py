Running Baseline RL Simulation with Norm Penalty...

--- Running with Penalty P = 0.00 ---
Final Q-values: Good=1.000, Bad=3.000
Proportion 'Action_Good' chosen in last 50 trials: 0.06

--- Running with Penalty P = 1.50 ---
Final Q-values: Good=1.000, Bad=1.500
Proportion 'Action_Good' chosen in last 50 trials: 0.08

--- Running with Penalty P = 2.50 ---
Final Q-values: Good=1.000, Bad=0.500
Proportion 'Action_Good' chosen in last 50 trials: 0.90

--- Running with Penalty P = 4.00 ---
Final Q-values: Good=1.000, Bad=-1.000
Proportion 'Action_Good' chosen in last 50 trials: 0.96
