# NES Blueprint v3: The Normative Executive System

## Comparator Module – Drift-Diffusion Evidence Accumulator  
The Comparator integrates multiple impulse signals via a continuous drift-diffusion process. At each time step, each candidate impulse $i$ accumulates evidence $E_i(t)$ with drift  
$$v_i = w_s\,S_i + w_n\,N_i + w_u\,U_i + \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma),$$  
where $S_i$ is perceptual salience, $N_i$ is normative congruence (positive if aligned with active norms, negative if violating them), and $U_i$ is urgency or goal-driven bias. Noise $\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma)$ reflects stochastic fluctuations. Each impulse’s evidence updates as $E_i \leftarrow E_i + v_i\,\Delta t$, with decay (leak) applied to non-favored impulses. If $E_i$ crosses the upper decision bound ($\Theta_{\text{upper}}$), the impulse is approved; if it crosses a lower bound ($\Theta_{\text{lower}}$), it is vetoed (rejected). If no bound is reached within a time limit, the decision stalls and the RAA intervenes.  

Emotional and affective inputs can directly bias the Comparator. For example, amygdala-driven arousal can amplify evidence for threat-related or reward-related impulses, effectively biasing drift rates (as in neural-affective models like ANDREA ([Futurehouse Research - Integrating Affective States Research.md](file://file-GVxZJdi5CmqR7Nig6fBi6K#:~:text=The%20Neural%20Affective%20Decision%20Theory%2C,effects%20and%20loss%20aversion%20are))). In practice, a strong fearful cue might transiently boost $N_i$ for defensive impulses or add a negative bias to drift for risky actions. Such models and data show that arousal and valence dynamically modulate evidence accumulation parameters ([Futurehouse Research - Integrating Affective States Research.md](file://file-GVxZJdi5CmqR7Nig6fBi6K#:~:text=The%20Neural%20Affective%20Decision%20Theory%2C,effects%20and%20loss%20aversion%20are)) ([Futurehouse Research - Integrating Affective States Research.md](file://file-GVxZJdi5CmqR7Nig6fBi6K#:~:text=Overall%2C%20the%20claim%20has%20been,75)). This means NES can emulate findings where, say, anger or sadness alter drift rates and starting biases in decision tasks; extended DDM studies have explicitly modeled these effects ([Futurehouse Research - Integrating Affective States Research.md](file://file-GVxZJdi5CmqR7Nig6fBi6K#:~:text=The%20Drift%20Diffusion%20Model%20,shown%20to%20decrease%20thresholds%20while)) ([Futurehouse Research - Integrating Affective States Research.md](file://file-GVxZJdi5CmqR7Nig6fBi6K#:~:text=Overall%2C%20the%20claim%20has%20been,75)). In summary, the Comparator merges sensory salience, norm-congruence, and urgency, all possibly re-weighted by current affect, into a unified accumulator that triggers or vetoes actions.

## Assent Gate – Dynamic Threshold Modulation  
The Assent Gate controls decision caution by setting symmetric decision thresholds $(\Theta_{\text{upper}}, \Theta_{\text{lower}})$ for the Comparator. The baseline threshold $\Theta_{\text{base}}$ may depend on context or task (e.g. importance of accuracy). Serotonin-like neuromodulation is modeled by adjusting these bounds: a high serotonin signal effectively raises $\Theta$, slowing decisions for caution, while low serotonin lowers $\Theta$ for speed. As shown in simulation, lowering $\Theta$ (low 5HT) dramatically speeds responses, whereas raising $\Theta$ (high 5HT) slows them, replicating classic speed–accuracy trade-offs ([simulation results report full v3.md](file://file-Mgahvt3Ae41kW7tX22ZsTe#:~:text=,0%29%20raises%20threshold%2C%20slowing%20them)).  

Affective states further adjust thresholds in real time. “Hot” emotions (anger, excitement) tend to lower the threshold, promoting impulsivity, while “cold” emotions (fear, sadness) raise it, enforcing caution. For instance, intense fear might add $\Delta\Theta>0$ to raise the bar for action; exhilaration or anger could add $\Delta\Theta<0$ to hasten a response. This echoes computational findings: the ANDREA model, for example, explicitly links amygdala arousal to changes in decision thresholds via neuromodulators ([Futurehouse Research - Integrating Affective States Research.md](file://file-GVxZJdi5CmqR7Nig6fBi6K#:~:text=The%20Neural%20Affective%20Decision%20Theory%2C,effects%20and%20loss%20aversion%20are)). Similarly, drift-diffusion studies report that negative affect (e.g. sadness) elevates threshold while anger lowers it, and that facial emotion cues can modulate non-decision time or bias parameters ([Futurehouse Research - Integrating Affective States Research.md](file://file-GVxZJdi5CmqR7Nig6fBi6K#:~:text=The%20Drift%20Diffusion%20Model%20,shown%20to%20decrease%20thresholds%20while)) ([Futurehouse Research - Integrating Affective States Research.md](file://file-GVxZJdi5CmqR7Nig6fBi6K#:~:text=Overall%2C%20the%20claim%20has%20been,75)). In sum, NES’s Assent Gate is modulated by both long-term serotonin-like control and transient emotions, consistent with theories where affect dynamically tunes caution and impulsivity ([Futurehouse Research - Integrating Affective States Research.md](file://file-GVxZJdi5CmqR7Nig6fBi6K#:~:text=The%20Neural%20Affective%20Decision%20Theory%2C,effects%20and%20loss%20aversion%20are)) ([Futurehouse Research - Integrating Affective States Research.md](file://file-GVxZJdi5CmqR7Nig6fBi6K#:~:text=Overall%2C%20the%20claim%20has%20been,75)). 

### Emotion and Affective Modulation (New)  
Recent models in cognitive neuroscience and affective computing explicitly simulate how emotional states influence decision dynamics. For example, the **Neural Affective Decision Theory (ANDREA)** models amygdala and orbitofrontal interactions: heightened amygdala activity (arousal) shifts decision parameters akin to altering thresholds and valuation processes ([Futurehouse Research - Integrating Affective States Research.md](file://file-GVxZJdi5CmqR7Nig6fBi6K#:~:text=The%20Neural%20Affective%20Decision%20Theory%2C,effects%20and%20loss%20aversion%20are)). Likewise, extended DDM frameworks (Roberts & Hutcherson, 2019) show that specific emotions systematically change threshold and drift rates: sadness tends to increase caution (higher threshold), while anger lowers it, with nuanced effects on processing times ([Futurehouse Research - Integrating Affective States Research.md](file://file-GVxZJdi5CmqR7Nig6fBi6K#:~:text=The%20Drift%20Diffusion%20Model%20,shown%20to%20decrease%20thresholds%20while)) ([Futurehouse Research - Integrating Affective States Research.md](file://file-GVxZJdi5CmqR7Nig6fBi6K#:~:text=Overall%2C%20the%20claim%20has%20been,75)). Other approaches use real-time physiological inputs (EEG, pupilometry, heart rate) to map arousal fluctuations onto DDM parameters, demonstrating that transient emotional spikes can recalibrate both evidence accumulation and decision bounds ([Futurehouse Research - Integrating Affective States Research.md](file://file-GVxZJdi5CmqR7Nig6fBi6K#:~:text=Complementing%20these%20approaches%2C%20Therior%E2%80%99s%20work,23)) ([Futurehouse Research - Integrating Affective States Research.md](file://file-GVxZJdi5CmqR7Nig6fBi6K#:~:text=Overall%2C%20the%20claim%20has%20been,75)).  In NES, these insights justify modeling an **affective appraisal module** that continually adjusts the Assent Gate and Comparator: for instance, fear might temporarily boost the norm weight $w_n$ for harm-avoidance norms and raise $\Theta$, whereas anger might boost the salience of justice norms and lower $\Theta$. Critically, these affective adjustments act on the same mechanisms as serotonin modulation and urgency signals, unifying them into a coherent framework ([Futurehouse Research - Integrating Affective States Research.md](file://file-GVxZJdi5CmqR7Nig6fBi6K#:~:text=The%20Neural%20Affective%20Decision%20Theory%2C,effects%20and%20loss%20aversion%20are)) ([Futurehouse Research - Integrating Affective States Research.md](file://file-GVxZJdi5CmqR7Nig6fBi6K#:~:text=Overall%2C%20the%20claim%20has%20been,75)).

## Norm Repository and Conflict Resolution  
The Norm Repository is a structured long-term memory of the agent’s norms and values. Each norm is stored with rich metadata: a numeric weight (priority), a deontic tag (Obligatory, Forbidden, Guideline, etc.), a context scope (when it applies), source (how it was learned), and reinforcement history. Strict moral norms are given high weight and often a “veto flag” (e.g. “never kill innocents” might be weight 0.9, veto=True); social conventions have moderate weight and context tags; personal goals act as flexible self-imposed norms. The repository updates over time via reinforcement (norms gain weight when followed) and decay (unused norms fade), so the agent’s value system can adapt. 

**Precedent Systems:** NES’s explicit norm store and veto mechanism have clear analogues in prior work. The *Cognitive Social Learners* (CSL) architecture uses a structured normative KB embedded in a BDI-like loop: agents consult stored norms by context and use a veto step to block norm-violating intentions ([Futurehouse Research - Norm and Veto research.md](file://file-VC7SdspFGLWNHzowa8J3ae#:~:text=One%20clear%20example%20is%20the,actions%20when%20normative%20conflicts%20arise)). In healthcare-oriented BDI agents, norms are encoded in deontic logic (OBLIGED, FORBIDDEN, etc.) and enforced by interrupting or overriding the intention selection process whenever a high-priority rule is violated ([Futurehouse Research - Norm and Veto research.md](file://file-VC7SdspFGLWNHzowa8J3ae#:~:text=Another%20example%20is%20provided%20by,reconsideration%20or%20an%20override%20of)). In value-engineering AI, planners carry value-annotated plans in repositories and employ constraint solvers to reject any plan conflicting with core values (effectively a veto) ([Futurehouse Research - Norm and Veto research.md](file://file-VC7SdspFGLWNHzowa8J3ae#:~:text=G%C3%B3mez%E2%80%99s%20work%20on%20value%20engineering,in%20complex%2C%20multidimensional%20decision%20scenarios)). Social robotics frameworks (design-for-values) use prioritized value-norm trees: when two norms compete, the higher-level value acts as a categorical veto on the lower ([Futurehouse Research - Norm and Veto research.md](file://file-VC7SdspFGLWNHzowa8J3ae#:~:text=Lastly%2C%20Virginia%20et%20al,would%20breach%20the%20prioritized%20constraints)). All these systems feature *structured norm knowledge* plus *hard constraints* that override default action selection, mirroring NES’s repository and Assent Gate veto. This convergence demonstrates that the NES design aligns with established approaches to embedding normative rules and vetoes in cognitive architectures ([Futurehouse Research - Norm and Veto research.md](file://file-VC7SdspFGLWNHzowa8J3ae#:~:text=One%20clear%20example%20is%20the,actions%20when%20normative%20conflicts%20arise)) ([Futurehouse Research - Norm and Veto research.md](file://file-VC7SdspFGLWNHzowa8J3ae#:~:text=Another%20example%20is%20provided%20by,reconsideration%20or%20an%20override%20of)) ([Futurehouse Research - Norm and Veto research.md](file://file-VC7SdspFGLWNHzowa8J3ae#:~:text=Lastly%2C%20Virginia%20et%20al,would%20breach%20the%20prioritized%20constraints)). 

The **Norm Conflict Resolver** is invoked when one impulse is supported by some norms and opposed by others. It tallies the weights of applicable norms “for” versus “against” the impulse. If any active norm with veto flag opposes the impulse, the resolver outputs a categorical “Reject (veto)”. Otherwise it compares aggregate weights: if supporting weight > opposing weight, it recommends “Allow”, otherwise “Reject”. A tied outcome returns “Unresolved”. This weighted-voting-with-veto algorithm formalizes a kind of deontic logic: absolute prohibitions act as overrides, while lesser norms form a soft vote ([Futurehouse Research - Norm and Veto research.md](file://file-VC7SdspFGLWNHzowa8J3ae#:~:text=Another%20example%20is%20provided%20by,reconsideration%20or%20an%20override%20of)) ([Futurehouse Research - Norm and Veto research.md](file://file-VC7SdspFGLWNHzowa8J3ae#:~:text=Lastly%2C%20Virginia%20et%20al,would%20breach%20the%20prioritized%20constraints)). In effect, the Norm Conflict Resolver operationalizes ethical decision policies (akin to Castelfranchi’s voting/veto model) by ensuring that conflicting norms are resolved according to priority. Notably, like normative BDI systems, NES treats norm compliance not as just another utility term but as a decision constraint: even if an action has high reward or salience, a violated strong norm can veto it outright ([Futurehouse Research - Norm and Veto research.md](file://file-VC7SdspFGLWNHzowa8J3ae#:~:text=Another%20example%20is%20provided%20by,reconsideration%20or%20an%20override%20of)) ([Futurehouse Research - Norm and Veto research.md](file://file-VC7SdspFGLWNHzowa8J3ae#:~:text=Lastly%2C%20Virginia%20et%20al,would%20breach%20the%20prioritized%20constraints)). 

## Recursive Adjudication Agent (RAA) – Meta-Control Layer  
The RAA monitors the decision process and intervenes under impasse or extreme stakes. **Entry conditions:** The RAA triggers when evidence accumulation stalls (no decision by a typical deadline) or the Norm Conflict Resolver returns an unresolved tie. It also observes if multiple impulses each have moderate evidence. For example, if 3 seconds pass with no threshold crossed, or if norms leave a decision in doubt, RAA labels the situation a conflict ([Blueprint v2.docx](file://file-TkfkgL73mbt1HWF2L5wgAd#:~:text=Conflict%20Detection%3A%20Check%20if%20the,the%20situation%20as%20a%20conflict%2Fimpasse)).  

**Operation:** When triggered, RAA executes one or more recursive deliberation cycles. In each cycle it may:  
- **Invoke Norm Resolver:** Re-run the Norm Conflict Resolver if not done, obtaining any veto (“Reject impulse X”) or approval (“Allow impulse X”) ([Blueprint v2.docx](file://file-TkfkgL73mbt1HWF2L5wgAd#:~:text=Conflict%20Detection%3A%20Check%20if%20the,the%20situation%20as%20a%20conflict%2Fimpasse)) ([Blueprint v2.docx](file://file-TkfkgL73mbt1HWF2L5wgAd#:~:text=Engaging%20the%20Norm%20Conflict%20Resolver,which%20RAA%20can%20then%20enforce)). If an absolute veto is found, RAA halts further cycles and enforces the veto.  
- **Adjust parameters:** Increase a norm weight or urgency to tip the balance. For example, if two impulses tie, RAA might boost the weight of the stricter norm to favor restraint, or raise urgency $U_i$ if a decision is pressing ([Blueprint v2.docx](file://file-TkfkgL73mbt1HWF2L5wgAd#:~:text=Adjusting%20parameters%3A%20If%20conflict%20stems,)). It can also temporarily raise or lower thresholds via the Assent Gate (e.g. increase $\Theta$ to demand more evidence for a risky action, or decrease $\Theta$ if stalling too long) ([Blueprint v2.docx](file://file-TkfkgL73mbt1HWF2L5wgAd#:~:text=Adjusting%20parameters%3A%20If%20conflict%20stems,)).  
- **Re-evaluate or Seek Info:** Optionally, RAA could prompt retrieval of relevant information or a higher-level principle (e.g. check a meta-norm like “prefer safety if in doubt”); this abstractly represents the agent reconsidering context.  
- **Handle Multiple Impulses:** If multiple actions compete, RAA may prioritize. For instance, it could focus on the most urgent or norm-relevant impulse first, suspending others ([Blueprint v2.docx](file://file-TkfkgL73mbt1HWF2L5wgAd#:~:text=Arbitrate%20Multi,be%20resolved%20before%20B)). Each cycle, after these adjustments, RAA signals the Comparator and Assent Gate to resume accumulation with updated settings ([Blueprint v2.docx](file://file-TkfkgL73mbt1HWF2L5wgAd#:~:text=Continue%20Iteration%3A%20RAA%20then%20signals,or%20any%20learning%20that%20occurred)).  

**Stopping Conditions:** RAA enforces finite limits. It tracks the number of recursion cycles and elapsed time. A cap $N_{\max}$ (e.g. 2–3) is set—after that, if no decision is reached, RAA conservatively defaults to **withhold action** (favor inaction) ([Blueprint v2.docx](file://file-TkfkgL73mbt1HWF2L5wgAd#:~:text=Stopping%20Conditions%3A%20RAA%20monitors%20the,and%20terminate%20further%20deliberation)). However, the RAA may stop early if a cycle yields a clear outcome (e.g. a norm veto) ([Blueprint v2.docx](file://file-TkfkgL73mbt1HWF2L5wgAd#:~:text=Stopping%20Conditions%3A%20RAA%20monitors%20the,and%20terminate%20further%20deliberation)). It also checks deadlines: if a decision must be made immediately, RAA will force the current highest-evidence choice (“leap to action”) or follow a meta-rule (e.g. “if out of time, pick safer option”) ([Blueprint v2.docx](file://file-TkfkgL73mbt1HWF2L5wgAd#:~:text=Stopping%20Conditions%3A%20RAA%20monitors%20the,and%20terminate%20further%20deliberation)). Finally, if stakes are high and no solution emerges, the system can either refuse to decide or escalate to an emergency override, depending on design (these are beyond current scope). 

*Example Pseudocode Sketch:*  
```
if (decision timeout OR NormResolver returned tie) then:
    for cycle = 1 to N_max:
        NormResult = runNormResolver(impulses, norms)
        if NormResult == "Veto impulse X": output "Reject X" and exit loop
        adjust parameters: boost relevant weights or urgency
        continue Comparator with new parameters
        if decision reached: break
    end
    if no decision after N_max: output "No action" (conservative default)
end
```

This logic ensures the RAA adds a controlled “second look” without infinite regress ([Blueprint v2.docx](file://file-TkfkgL73mbt1HWF2L5wgAd#:~:text=Conflict%20Detection%3A%20Check%20if%20the,the%20situation%20as%20a%20conflict%2Fimpasse)) ([Blueprint v2.docx](file://file-TkfkgL73mbt1HWF2L5wgAd#:~:text=Stopping%20Conditions%3A%20RAA%20monitors%20the,and%20terminate%20further%20deliberation)). Neuroscience studies support analogous mechanisms: for instance, conflict monitoring in the ACC triggers shifts in threshold (within ~300–500ms) and engages prefrontal arbitration under difficult decisions ([Futurehouse Research - NES and RAA.md](file://file-VdxYM3bP3RV8Bp5DGvdbUT#:~:text=,The%20ACC%20shows%20threshold)). In simulation of a moral dilemma, setting the RAA trigger at 60% of the deadline and allowing up to 3 cycles (with an urgency boost of ~0.4) led to about 62% of trials invoking recursion and resolved all formerly deadlocked cases ([simulation results report full v3.md](file://file-Mgahvt3Ae41kW7tX22ZsTe#:~:text=,RAA%20resolved%20all%20deadlocks)). This suggests practical parameter ranges: RAA should engage under prolonged conflict (~1–2 seconds) and may only need 1–2 extra cycles per hard choice ([simulation results report full v3.md](file://file-Mgahvt3Ae41kW7tX22ZsTe#:~:text=,RAA%20resolved%20all%20deadlocks)) ([simulation results report full v3.md](file://file-Mgahvt3Ae41kW7tX22ZsTe#:~:text=,boost%20cycle%20sufficed%20for%20unanimous)). 

## Candidate Neural Implementation  
NES’s modules can be mapped onto known brain circuits involved in control, valuation, and emotion. The **Comparator** resembles cortical accumulation networks (e.g. lateral intraparietal area, frontal eye fields) that integrate evidence in decision tasks. The **Assent Gate** (threshold control) aligns with the **subthalamic nucleus (STN)** and prefrontal circuits: STN firing (and theta oscillations) rapidly increases when conflict or need for inhibition is detected, effectively raising decision bounds ([Futurehouse Research - NES and RAA.md](file://file-VdxYM3bP3RV8Bp5DGvdbUT#:~:text=,42%2C%20ghahremani2018thefunctionalrole)). In the Stroop paradigm, STN activation has been recorded ~100–300ms post-conflict, delaying responses (consistent with raising $\Theta$) ([Futurehouse Research - NES and RAA.md](file://file-VdxYM3bP3RV8Bp5DGvdbUT#:~:text=,42%2C%20ghahremani2018thefunctionalrole)). The **Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)** is implicated in conflict monitoring: it detects competing impulses and signals for control adjustments. For example, fMRI shows ACC activity correlating with threshold shifts (within 300–500ms) during high-conflict decisions ([Futurehouse Research - NES and RAA.md](file://file-VdxYM3bP3RV8Bp5DGvdbUT#:~:text=,The%20ACC%20shows%20threshold)).  

Crucially, the **ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)** and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) are prime candidates for implementing the Norm Repository and valuation. These regions integrate subjective value and normative information. Studies demonstrate that vmPFC encodes a combination of economic value and social/normative value and can modulate decision thresholds. For instance, Chu et al. (2023) found vmPFC jointly represents value and norm signals in approach-avoidance conflicts ([Futurehouse Research - NES and RAA.md](file://file-VdxYM3bP3RV8Bp5DGvdbUT#:~:text=,The%20ACC%20shows%20threshold)). A computational review (Duggins, 2023) reports that vmPFC (with ACC and OFC) adjusts decision caution in social contexts: roughly a 10–30% increase in the decision threshold was observed when norm-related considerations dominated ([Futurehouse Research - NES and RAA.md](file://file-VdxYM3bP3RV8Bp5DGvdbUT#:~:text=,indicates%20that%20decision%20thresholds%20may)). These findings suggest vmPFC/OFC compute the net “normative utility” $N_i$ and push the system towards compliance or restraint.  Limbic inputs to vmPFC/OFC (notably from the amygdala) provide affective tagging: fear-conditioned amygdala signals can prime vmPFC to heighten caution, whereas reward signals can bias it towards action. In the ANDREA framework, amygdala-driven arousal modulates orbitofrontal valuation via neuromodulators, altering both evidence and thresholds ([Futurehouse Research - Integrating Affective States Research.md](file://file-GVxZJdi5CmqR7Nig6fBi6K#:~:text=The%20Neural%20Affective%20Decision%20Theory%2C,effects%20and%20loss%20aversion%20are)) ([Futurehouse Research - Integrating Affective States Research.md](file://file-GVxZJdi5CmqR7Nig6fBi6K#:~:text=Overall%2C%20the%20claim%20has%20been,75)). Thus, the **amygdala–vmPFC pathway** in biology provides a direct route for emotion to influence NES: for example, a fear response might transiently increase vmPFC/OFC activity that up-weights harm-avoidance norms or triggers larger $\Theta$ via STN. 

Other areas fit NES components: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) could implement RAA’s rule-based control and working-memory of norms; basal ganglia circuits (beyond STN) could gate impulses. Serotonergic (dorsal raphe) projections to prefrontal cortex likely mediate the neurochemical “threshold” signal (consistent with the 5HT-like threshold shifts in NES). In sum, NES is consistent with a distributed control network: parietal/frontal accumulators (Comparator), STN/ACC threshold gating (Assent Gate), vmPFC/OFC norm integration, and limbic influences (amygdala) on all stages ([Futurehouse Research - NES and RAA.md](file://file-VdxYM3bP3RV8Bp5DGvdbUT#:~:text=,The%20ACC%20shows%20threshold)) ([Futurehouse Research - Integrating Affective States Research.md](file://file-GVxZJdi5CmqR7Nig6fBi6K#:~:text=The%20Neural%20Affective%20Decision%20Theory%2C,effects%20and%20loss%20aversion%20are)). These parallels give neuroscientific precedent for each NES mechanism and support plausible parameter ranges (e.g. ~100ms delays for threshold changes, 10–30% modulation of bounds by norms).

## Comparative Analysis with Other Frameworks  
NES synthesizes elements from diverse cognitive architectures and decision models, while also diverging in key ways:

- **BDI and Normative BDI Models:** Traditional Belief-Desire-Intention agents use logical rules (productions) to select actions, and normative extensions embed obligations/prohibitions into the reasoning cycle. Like NES, they maintain an explicit norm knowledge base, but BDI selects actions in discrete steps (intention formation) rather than via continuous accumulation. In normative BDI, violating a high-priority rule triggers a dynamic reconsideration or override of intentions ([Futurehouse Research - Norm and Veto research.md](file://file-VC7SdspFGLWNHzowa8J3ae#:~:text=Another%20example%20is%20provided%20by,reconsideration%20or%20an%20override%20of)), analogous to NES’s veto. However, NES adds real-time weighting and affect: norms influence a gradual evidence sum (not just binary conditions), and emotion/neuromodulation modulates the process. In effect, NES can be seen as a **quantitative BDI** where rules carry numeric weights and decisions emerge from DDM dynamics, rather than a purely symbolic impulse of reason. This bridges symbolic norm-logic with graded decision-making.  

- **Utility-Maximizing RL (including Hierarchical RL):** In pure reinforcement learning, actions are chosen to maximize expected reward. NES differs fundamentally by enforcing **hard constraints**: an action that violates a top norm will be vetoed regardless of its reward. In hierarchical RL, higher-level policies can override lower options if reward estimates are lower, but this is framed in terms of accumulated value. NES’s RAA+Norm Resolver acts like an RL meta-controller *trained* on norms instead of rewards—its overrides are rule-based (normative) rather than learned reward-maximization. Importantly, RL agents do not inherently model the decision conflict that arises from explicit norms; any “internalized values” must be encoded indirectly in the reward function. NES, in contrast, treats norms as separate from rewards. Thus NES fills a gap between goal-driven RL and rule-based ethics: it enforces compliance beyond utility optimization.  

- **Symbolic Planners and Production Systems (e.g. ACT-R, Soar, PDDL planners):** These systems plan or reason by manipulating symbols and rules. They often rely on backtracking or subgoaling for conflict, but typically lack continuous inhibition mechanisms. NES’s Comparator could in principle be simulated by a rapid-fire production system, but classical planners usually don’t include stochastic evidence accumulation or emotion. NES provides a mathematical decision policy (drift-diffusion with veto) that symbolic models lack. Conversely, symbolic models can easily encode complex goals and logical constraints. NES’s novelty is in operationalizing such constraints within a stochastic decision loop. One could say NES is to planning what stochastic search is to deterministic search: it adds noise, thresholds, and affect.  

- **Utility vs Norm-Logic Integration:** NES explicitly bridges these by carrying both explicit rules (from the Norm Repository) and a utility-like evidence accumulator. Emotional/affective signals modulate the same framework, whereas traditional logic-based systems do not account for affect. Computational frameworks like ANDREA and affective DDMs have illustrated how an accumulator can include emotion and “hot” values ([Futurehouse Research - Integrating Affective States Research.md](file://file-GVxZJdi5CmqR7Nig6fBi6K#:~:text=The%20Neural%20Affective%20Decision%20Theory%2C,effects%20and%20loss%20aversion%20are)) ([Futurehouse Research - Integrating Affective States Research.md](file://file-GVxZJdi5CmqR7Nig6fBi6K#:~:text=Overall%2C%20the%20claim%20has%20been,75)). NES takes this further by adding a normative veto layer on top. In summary, NES aligns with decision-theoretic models in its quantitative structure, and with rule-based models in its explicit norms. This unified approach is unique: it ensures each decision is both value-driven and ethical. 

Overall, NES can be viewed as an **algorithmic bridge** between normative BDI-like architectures and affective reinforcement-leaning models. It shares RL’s clarity and learnability (weights can adapt from data) ([simulation results report full v3.md](file://file-Mgahvt3Ae41kW7tX22ZsTe)), and it shares symbolic models’ explicit knowledge of what is right or wrong ([Futurehouse Research - Norm and Veto research.md](file://file-VC7SdspFGLWNHzowa8J3ae#:~:text=Another%20example%20is%20provided%20by,reconsideration%20or%20an%20override%20of)) ([Futurehouse Research - Norm and Veto research.md](file://file-VC7SdspFGLWNHzowa8J3ae#:~:text=Lastly%2C%20Virginia%20et%20al,would%20breach%20the%20prioritized%20constraints)). Unlike purely psychological dual-process concepts, NES specifies *how* intuition and deliberation interact (via threshold and recursion), avoiding the “mysterious homunculus” critique. In comparative terms, NES inherits distributed control from HRL and ACT-R, formalizes executive control like conflict-monitoring theories, and implements affective drift dynamics seen in neuroscience models ([Futurehouse Research - Integrating Affective States Research.md](file://file-GVxZJdi5CmqR7Nig6fBi6K#:~:text=The%20Neural%20Affective%20Decision%20Theory%2C,effects%20and%20loss%20aversion%20are)) ([Futurehouse Research - Integrating Affective States Research.md](file://file-GVxZJdi5CmqR7Nig6fBi6K#:~:text=Overall%2C%20the%20claim%20has%20been,75)). Its distinct contribution is the explicit *normative executive* that can veto or confirm every urge, grounded both in decision science and neurobiology.

## Simulation Results and Model Validation  
Key predictions of NES have been validated in computational simulations across several tasks. The model exhibits classic patterns when norms, conflict, and modulation are varied:

- **Stroop (Conflict):** Under neutral norms, NES replicates the expected conflict slowdown: mean RT was 0.651s on congruent vs. 0.787s on incongruent trials ([simulation results report full v3.md](file://file-Mgahvt3Ae41kW7tX22ZsTe#:~:text=,)), with both near-perfect accuracy. Modulating the Assent Gate threshold produced systematic speed–accuracy shifts: lowering the threshold (low 5HT) accelerated decisions (mean RT 0.390s) while raising it (high 5HT) slowed them (1.185s) ([simulation results report full v3.md](file://file-Mgahvt3Ae41kW7tX22ZsTe#:~:text=,)). These findings match human data and classic DDM results. In parameter fitting (with a collapsing bound), NES achieved ~97% accuracy on incongruent trials while preserving perfect congruent accuracy ([simulation results report full v3.md](file://file-Mgahvt3Ae41kW7tX22ZsTe#:~:text=,0.130)), confirming that the architecture can quantitatively mimic the Stroop effect (though further tuning is needed for an exact RT match ([simulation results report full v3.md](file://file-Mgahvt3Ae41kW7tX22ZsTe#:~:text=,0.130))).

- **Go/No-Go (Inhibitory Control):** The model’s output showed a strong threshold effect: under a low threshold (low 5HT), Go RTs were fast (0.358s) with 100% hits; under high threshold (high 5HT), RTs slowed to 1.070s ([simulation results report full v3.md](file://file-Mgahvt3Ae41kW7tX22ZsTe#:~:text=,)). Importantly, NES produced 0% false alarms in the No-Go condition ([simulation results report full v3.md](file://file-Mgahvt3Ae41kW7tX22ZsTe#:~:text=,)). This indicates that raising the gate can eliminate commission errors (though real agents show some errors, suggesting future work could add noise or delays). Overall, results confirm that raising $\Theta$ (modeled as serotonin) increases caution as predicted.

- **Delay Discounting (Temporal Choice):** Fitting a hyperbolic reward model, NES captured human-like patience profiles with minimal error (sum-squared error ≈0.007) ([simulation results report full v3.md](file://file-Mgahvt3Ae41kW7tX22ZsTe)). Lower base thresholds biased choices toward the smaller-sooner (SS) option, while higher thresholds favored larger-later (LL) options, just as theory predicts. Reaction times rose with longer delays, mirroring empirical trends ([simulation results report full v3.md](file://file-Mgahvt3Ae41kW7tX22ZsTe)) ([simulation results report full v3.md](file://file-Mgahvt3Ae41kW7tX22ZsTe#:~:text=,delay%2C%20qualitatively%20matching%20empirical%20trends)). In the best-fit simulation, the model’s log-likelihoods closely matched target human data across delays 1–50s ([simulation results report full v3.md](file://file-Mgahvt3Ae41kW7tX22ZsTe)). These quantitative fits bolster NES’s claim to unify patience and impulse control via the same accumulator–gate mechanism.

- **Moral Dilemma (Norm Conflict & Veto):** The NES was tested in a conflict of two contradictory norms (e.g. honesty vs. preventing harm). Under “balanced” norm weights, the Comparator stalled: 498 of 500 trials timed out without RAA intervention ([simulation results report full v3.md](file://file-Mgahvt3Ae41kW7tX22ZsTe#:~:text=3,Conflict%20%26%20Veto)), demonstrating decision paralysis when norms are in perfect opposition. In contrast, when one norm was designated a veto, the model immediately sided with the stronger norm (0% lie rate when honesty vetoed, 100% lie rate when no-harm vetoed) with near-zero RT ([simulation results report full v3.md](file://file-Mgahvt3Ae41kW7tX22ZsTe#:~:text=,)), showing that an absolute veto bypasses normal deliberation as intended. These outcomes underscore that without recursion, NES strictly enforces veto rules, and deadlocks can occur in tight conflicts.

- **RAA Engagement (Deadlock Resolution):** Allowing the RAA to act under the balanced-norm dilemma dramatically changed outcomes. With the RAA trigger set at 60% of the allowed time and permitting up to 3 cycles (urgency boost = 0.4), roughly 62.2% of trials engaged the RAA ([simulation results report full v3.md](file://file-Mgahvt3Ae41kW7tX22ZsTe#:~:text=,RAA%20resolved%20all%20deadlocks)). In these trials, about half chose the “lie” and half “truth,” reflecting true conflict resolution; mean RT was 1.834s, consistent with the trigger point used ([simulation results report full v3.md](file://file-Mgahvt3Ae41kW7tX22ZsTe#:~:text=,RAA%20resolved%20all%20deadlocks)). Crucially, the RAA prevented any timeouts: all 500 trials ended in a decision ([simulation results report full v3.md](file://file-Mgahvt3Ae41kW7tX22ZsTe#:~:text=,RAA%20resolved%20all%20deadlocks)) ([simulation results report full v3.md](file://file-Mgahvt3Ae41kW7tX22ZsTe#:~:text=,boost%20cycle%20sufficed%20for%20unanimous)). On average, only one extra cycle was needed per engaged trial. These results validate NES’s RAA strategy: it reliably detects deadlock (triggering in ~60% of high-conflict cases) and restores full decision throughput without sacrificing consistency ([simulation results report full v3.md](file://file-Mgahvt3Ae41kW7tX22ZsTe#:~:text=,RAA%20resolved%20all%20deadlocks)) ([simulation results report full v3.md](file://file-Mgahvt3Ae41kW7tX22ZsTe#:~:text=,boost%20cycle%20sufficed%20for%20unanimous)).

In summary, the simulations confirm NES’s core predictions and mechanisms. The system reproduces conflict-driven slowdown (Stroop), threshold-based speed–accuracy trade-offs (Stroop, GNG), patience dynamics (Delay Discounting), and normative veto effects (Moral Dilemma) ([simulation results report full v3.md](file://file-Mgahvt3Ae41kW7tX22ZsTe#:~:text=,)) ([simulation results report full v3.md](file://file-Mgahvt3Ae41kW7tX22ZsTe)). The quantitative fits (especially in delay discounting) are strong, and the RAA module successfully resolves simulated deadlocks ([simulation results report full v3.md](file://file-Mgahvt3Ae41kW7tX22ZsTe#:~:text=,RAA%20resolved%20all%20deadlocks)). These empirical validations underscore NES’s capacity to model a wide range of cognitive-control phenomena under a single architecture.
