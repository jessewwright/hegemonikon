# Task
Has anyone explained the **developmental bootstrapping of rule-following and self-control** from early inhibition.

# Response
**Task:** Identify and analyze computational or theoretical models (developmental psychology, cogsci) that propose specific mechanisms for how:
1.  Early, basic inhibitory capacities (like infant gaze aversion or motor stopping) serve as a **scaffold**.
2.  Normative content (rules, values) becomes **progressively "loaded" onto** or integrated with these early control circuits through learning (imitation, instruction, reinforcement).
3.  This process avoids infinite regress (i.e., doesn't require complex norm understanding to learn the first norms).

**Provide:** Names, domains, core mechanisms proposed for this scaffolding/bootstrapping, references for 3-5 key examples. Summarize how these accounts align with or challenge NES's "kernel-then-calibration" developmental story.

Yes. Based on the relevant papers I found, multiple accounts propose mechanisms by which early inhibitory capacities scaffold later rule-following and self-control while integrating normative content without leading to infinite regress.

Early inhibitory capacities are posited as foundational, serving as the “kernel” upon which more sophisticated control processes are built. Best and Miller describe how early improvements in inhibition in infancy—evidenced by behaviors like gaze aversion and basic motor stopping—facilitate the emergence of higher-order executive functions such as shifting and planning. They argue that these basic inhibitory processes provide the initial framework for later complex rule-governed behaviors, effectively acting as a developmental scaffold (best2010adevelopmentalperspective pages 16-18, best2010adevelopmentalperspective pages 4-5).

In terms of integrating normative content, several models propose that learning processes such as imitation, instruction, and reinforcement progressively “load” normative rules onto these early control circuits. For instance, parental scaffolding models emphasize the role of contingent verbal interactions and guided support, which infuse normative rules and values into children’s developing executive functions. Bibok and colleagues show that parental verbal behaviors, including less directiveness and more elaboration, correlate with better integration of rule-following capabilities, indicating that external scaffolding translates into internalized self-control by providing normative content during critical developmental windows (bibok2009parentalscaffoldingand pages 4-6, hammond2012theeffectsof pages 10-10). Similarly, Garon et al. outline how early attentional and inhibitory skill development in infancy becomes increasingly coordinated with higher-order rule learning in the preschool years, suggesting that normative content is gradually embedded through both inductive learning and social interaction (garon2008executivefunctionin pages 18-19).

Turning to computational and theoretical approaches, Dagar’s models offer explicit mechanisms for this developmental bootstrapping. His hierarchical architectures—as seen in the HER model and related frameworks—demonstrate how concrete stimulus–response mappings, rooted in early inhibitory control, can be contextually modulated by higher-order representations. These representations are gradually built through reinforcement learning and selective attention processes, which allow for error-driven calibration. This structure permits abstract rules to be layered on top of established control kernels without necessitating an infinite regress of rule acquisition; instead, the system uses recurring bottom-up error signals and top-down contextual modulation to progressively refine behavior (dagar2023computationalmodelingof pages 156-159, dagar2023computationalmodelingof pages 132-136).

Further, the neural evidence presented by Dagar supports the idea that basic inhibitory functions provide a platform from which more abstract rule-following emerges via hierarchical organization of prefrontal regions. Lower-level PFC areas initially manage simple inhibitory responses, while higher-level areas gradually assume responsibility for abstract rule representation and error monitoring, thus embodying a “kernel-then-calibration” process (dagar2023computationalmodelingof pages 115-118, dagar2023computationalmodelingof pages 49-52). This hierarchical and error-based calibration mechanism directly aligns with the normative bootstrapping concept by ensuring early inhibitory control is incrementally enriched with normative content while avoiding an infinite regress in complexity.

In summary, the reviewed literature does support the claim that early basic inhibitory capacities serve as a foundational scaffold for later rule-following and self-control. Both developmental psychology accounts and computational models demonstrate how normative content is progressively integrated through social scaffolding, learning, and hierarchical neural organization, which altogether align with the NES “kernel-then-calibration” story (best2010adevelopmentalperspective pages 6-8, dagar2023computationalmodelingof pages 25-29, hendry2022inhibitorycontroland pages 18-19).
