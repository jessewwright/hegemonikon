# Task
Identify open behavioral and neuroimaging datasets from conflict-adaptation and rule-shift tasks suitable for fitting normative control architectures. For each dataset, provide access details, task descriptions, sample sizes, existing analysis codebases (e.g., HDDM, PyStan), and recommended parameter-fitting workflows (hierarchical Bayesian, MCMC).

# Response
The Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control (DMCC) dataset is one of the foremost open resources for investigating both conflict‐adaptation and rule‐shift tasks, and it is exceptionally well‐suited for fitting normative cognitive control architectures. The DMCC dataset includes multiple classic paradigms––for example, the Stroop task (a prototypical conflict‐adaptation task) and the Cued Task-Switching task (a rule‐shift paradigm)––as well as the AX Continuous Performance Task (AX-CPT) and the Sternberg working memory task (which contribute additional dimensions of cognitive control demands) (braver2021thedualmechanisms pages 13-15, etzel2022thedualmechanisms pages 15-18).  

Access details for the DMCC dataset are available on several open repositories. The dataset is hosted on OpenNeuro and OSF, with accompanying task presentation scripts and analysis codebases available via GitHub repositories. Specific URLs include osf.io/tbhfg/ and osf.io/48aet/, ensuring that both behavioral and neuroimaging data (acquired with a Siemens 3-T PRISMA scanner using multiband sequences and BOLD imaging) are freely accessible to researchers (braver2021thedualmechanisms pages 21-23, etzel2022thedualmechanisms pages 1-3). The publicly released DMCC55B subset, for example, comprises complete baseline data from 55 participants who performed all tasks within a within-subject design, permitting cross-task analysis and individual-differences modeling (braver2021thedualmechanisms pages 12-13, etzel2022thedualmechanisms pages 3-4).

Task descriptions are detailed and specific. The Stroop task, implemented with color naming and vocal responses, is designed to capture conflict-adaptation effects by contrasting incongruent and congruent trials, sometimes with two different color sets (MC and PC50) to further manipulate control demands (etzel2022thedualmechanisms pages 9-11). The Cued Task-Switching task, in which participants perform letter versus digit discriminations based on trial-specific cues, assorts trials into conditions such as repeat and switch, as well as congruent and incongruent, thereby indexing rule transformation demands (etzel2022thedualmechanisms pages 6-9). The AX-CPT task further supplements the battery by incorporating trial types with different contextual control demands (e.g., high-control BX trials) (etzel2022thedualmechanisms pages 6-9).  

The DMCC dataset provides extensive analysis resources. Preprocessing and analysis pipelines are implemented using state-of-the-art tools: anatomical and functional data are processed using fMRIPrep and further analyzed with AFNI software employing mixed blocked/event-related GLM modeling. Open scripts for behavioral scoring (e.g., vocal response extraction for the Stroop task implemented in MATLAB) are available on GitHub (braver2021thedualmechanisms pages 15-17, etzel2022thedualmechanisms pages 9-11). Existing codebases for multi-variate pattern analysis and discriminability analyses (e.g., cross-validated Mahalanobis distance, linear discriminant analysis) are also provided, which supports advanced normative model fitting.

For parameter-fitting, recommended workflows involve hierarchical Bayesian frameworks that can accommodate trial-level variability and cross-task integration. Specifically, researchers are advised to use hierarchical Bayesian modeling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, with available tools such as HDDM and PyStan, to statistically estimate latent parameters governing cognitive control processes (braver2021thedualmechanisms pages 23-25). These approaches allow one to fit parameters of normative control architectures that capture proactive versus reactive control dynamics across the different tasks. The availability of trial-by-trial behavioral data (reaction times and error rates) alongside carefully preprocessed BOLD responses strengthens the case for such complex parameter estimation procedures (etzel2022thedualmechanisms pages 18-20).

Another open dataset addressing similar cognitive constructs is provided by Bissett et al. This repository includes data from 103 healthy adult participants performing several self-regulation tasks—including the Stroop and Cued Task-Switching—which can also be used in modeling normative control architectures. The dataset is hosted on OpenNeuro and formatted according to the BIDS standard, ensuring compatibility with standard preprocessing tools like FMRIPrep and Nipype. While detailed analysis pipelines (e.g., HDDM or PyStan codebases) are not explicitly described, the Bissett dataset’s clear structure ensures that standard hierarchical Bayesian and MCMC workflows can be applied (bissett2024cognitivetasksanatomical pages 1-3, poldrack2013towardopensharing pages 6-7).
